In this project i was introduced to sass css preprocessor and npm packages. Scripts to compile css to sass,
autoprefixer and compile everything into production code.
I also focused on 7-1 sass architecture to organize my code which will make it easy to read and navigate through.
Basically i have a main.scss file which imports other sass files by using @import "folder/nameOfTheFile,
I also practiced implementing some animation using @Keyframes and also used @Support  because it allows me to use a variety of 'settings' for components depending on the browser support.
